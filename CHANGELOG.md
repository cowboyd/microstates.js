## [Unreleased]

## [0.11.0] - 2018-10-11

### Added
- New benchmarks based on TodoMVC, runnable via `yarn bench`
- Introduced the "femtostates" architecture. See below for breaking
  changes. See also
  https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/227
- The opaque type `Any` is now exported from the main microstates
  module. This is the type of `create(null)`
- The `Primitive` type which aliases a types `valueOf()` to the
  `.state` property is now exported frmo the main microstates module.
- The builtin types that correspond to JavaScript builtins are now, `ArrayType`,
  `ObjectType`, `BooleanType`, `StringType`, and `NumberType`.

### Changed
- `.state` property is no longer on every microstate, only on
  primitive types like `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, and `Any`. In
  order to get at the JavaScript value enclosed by a microstate, use
  the `valueOf()` method exported by the main package.
- All microstate properties are _completely_ lazily evaluated.
- Array microstates cannot be accessed by index, but must use the
  iterable interface.
- Type-shifting has been restricted to the `initialize` method.
