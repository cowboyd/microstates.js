## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Upgrading dependencies to upgrade version of [Funcadelic which fixed errors caused by Uglify removing names from typeclasses](https://github.com/cowboyd/funcadelic.js/pull/68) https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/343

## [0.13.0] - 2019-02-14

### Changed

- BREAKING: Transitions initiated from a microstate reference in the
  store, now return the new reference to the *same
  microstate*. Before, they always returned the root of the microstate
  tree, which made modelling side-effects difficult on deep microstate trees.
- Upgraded Rollup and associated plugins to latest version (via
  greenkeeper) #306, #307, #309, #310
- Fix up typos in README #308 (thanks @leonardodino)
- Improved code coverage in unit tests#320
- Remove several pieces of dead code that weren't serving any purpose
  #314, #318

### Fixed

- Passing a microstate to `Array#push` and `Array#unshift` allowed
  that microstate to become part of `valueOf`. Now, array unwraps all
  arguments before performing any operations.

## [0.12.4] - 2018-12-12

### Fixed

- Add explicit Profunctor class name to prevent the class name from being stripped by Uglifyjs https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/303

### Changed

- Gather all transitions from the prototype chain https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/290

## [0.12.3] - 2018-12-12

### Changed

- Gather all transitions from the prototype chain https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/290

## [0.12.2] - 2018-11-26

### Fixed

- Ensure Identity maps non-enumerable properties https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/284

## [0.12.1] - 2018-11-18

### Added

- ArrayType#remove transition https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/275
- ObjectType#Symbol.iterator to allow iterating objects in queries https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/276

### Changed

- No special case for the `set` transition https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/279

## [0.12.0] - 2018-10-31

### Fixed

- Store should allow destructuring microstates https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/263

### Added

- Added ObjectType#map and #ObjectType#filter transitions https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/225
- Added ArrayType#sort transition https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/245
- Added ArrayType#slice transition https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/249

### Changed

- ArrayType#map is now stable. array.map(x => x) is no-op https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/239
- ArrayType#filter is now stable. array.filter(x => true) is no-op https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/241
- Identity/Store no longer calls observer on creation (behaviour of Observer.from remains unchanged) https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/255 


## [0.11.0] - 2018-10-11

### Added
- New benchmarks based on TodoMVC, runnable via `yarn bench`
- Introduced the "femtostates" architecture. See below for breaking
  changes. See also
  https://github.com/microstates/microstates.js/pull/227
- The opaque type `Any` is now exported from the main microstates
  module. This is the type of `create(null)`
- The `Primitive` type which aliases a types `valueOf()` to the
  `.state` property is now exported frmo the main microstates module.
- The builtin types that correspond to JavaScript builtins are now, `ArrayType`,
  `ObjectType`, `BooleanType`, `StringType`, and `NumberType`.

### Changed
- `.state` property is no longer on every microstate, only on
  primitive types like `Number`, `String`, `Boolean`, and `Any`. In
  order to get at the JavaScript value enclosed by a microstate, use
  the `valueOf()` method exported by the main package.
- All microstate properties are _completely_ lazily evaluated.
- Array microstates cannot be accessed by index, but must use the
  iterable interface.
- Type-shifting has been restricted to the `initialize` method.
