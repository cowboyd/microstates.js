# Microstates

Microstates is a functional runtime type system designed to ease state management in component based applications. It allows to declaratively compose application state from atomic state machines.

By combining lazy execution, algebraic data types and structural sharing, we created a tool that provides a tiny API to describe complex data structures and provide a mechanism to change the value in an immutable way.

# Features

With Microstates added to your project, you get:

* üçá Composable type system
* üç± Reusable state atoms
* üíé Pure immutable state transitions without writing reducers
* ‚ö°Ô∏è Lazy and synchronous out of the box
* ü¶ã Most elegant way to express state machines
* üéØ Transpilation free type system
* üî≠ Optional integration with Observables
* ‚öõ Use in Node.js and browser

But, most imporantly, Microstates makes working with state fun.

**When was the last time you had fun working with state?**

For many, the answer is probably never, because state management in JavaScript is an endless game of compromises. You can choose to go fully immutable and write endless reducers. You can go mutable and everything becomes an observable. Or you can `setState` and lose the benefits of serialization and time travel debugging.

Unlike the view layer, where most frameworks agree on some variation of React's concept of components, none of the current crop of state management tools strike the same balance that React components introduced to the API.

React components have a tiny API. They are functional, simple and extremely reusable. The tiny API gives you high productivity for little necessary knowledge. Functional components are predictable and easy to reason about. They are conceptually simple, but simplicity hides an underlying architecture geared for performance. Their simplicity, predictability and isolation makes them composable and reusable.

These factors combined are what make React style components easy to work with and ultimately fun to write. A Tiny API abstracting a sophisticated architecture that delivers performance and is equaly useful on small and big projects is the outcome that we set out to achieve for state management with Microstates.

It's not easy to find the right balance between simplicity and power, but considering the importance of state management in web applications, we believe it's a worthy challenge.
<!-- 
# Why Microstates?

Our tools affect how we solve problems and collaborate.

Two tools can serve the same purpose but foster completely different ecosystems. Take jQuery plugins and React components as examples. Both of these tools provided a way to add custom behaviour to a DOM element but they fostered very different communities.

In the React world today, we see many special purpose components that are easily combined to create sophisticated user experiences. These components tend to have few options but provide just the right API for you to build what you need.

jQuery plugins, on the other hand, offer endsless lists of options that are difficult get just right. In the jQuery ecosystem, libraries tend to be monolithic because plugins from different libraries often do not work well together.

As a result, in the React ecosystem we see components like [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized) and [react-dnd](https://github.com/react-dnd/react-dnd) that are made by experienced React developers. These components save companies and developers millions of dollars in wasted development by eliminating the need for everyone to re-invent these components to build their user experiences.

The ability to leverage the experience of other developers in the form of published packages elevates our entire ecosystem. We call this _standing on the shoulders of giants_. Our goal is to bring this level of collaboration to state management.

## M in MVC

If you're a web developer and are using a framework, you might be wondering how Microstates will work within said framework. For now, I will say that we'll have an integration for each framework, but it's important that we're on the same page about the role of Microstates within your application. Once we have that, you'll see more ways to use Microstates than I can cover in this README.

Regardless of the kind of application you're building, your application is made of code that roughly represents data, converts user input into data and presents data to the user. This traditionally has been described as MVC pattern where M, model, is data that is persisted or accumulated through user actions or input. V, view, is how that data is presented to the user, often we describe with components and C, controller, which represents the constraints that exist on the user's actions.

Talking about MVC is a little pass√© in some communities, and understandbly so. Traditional MVC did not bring a lot of comfort to early adopters of web frameworks. Of the early adopters, only a few MVCish frameworks are left, but regardless of the popularity of the term, the architectural pattern is still a big part of our applications.


What we're seeing now is the discovery of what MVC looks like in modern web applications. One thing that most of us can agree on is that our views are now called components. Over the last 5 years, we saw a lot of competition in the view layer to make the most performant and ergonomic view building developer experience.

## Functional Models

The view boom was in big part ignited by the introduction of React. With React, came the introduction and mass adoption of functional programming ideas in the JavaScript ecosystem. Functional thinking brought a lot of simplicity to the view layer. It is conceptually simple - a component is a function that takes props and returns DOM. This simplicity helped developers learn React and has been adopted to a varied degree by most frameworks. The API that each frameworks exposes to their view is somewhat different but the general idea is the same.

Microstates brings the same kind of simplicity to the model layer. A Microstate is a functional model in a way that a component is a functional view. A component takes props and returns DOM; a Microstate takes value and returns state. DOM is a tree of element instances, state is a tree of model instances. A DOM tree is created by passing data to a root component. A state tree is created from a root type and value. A component is an abstraction that we use to manipulate the DOM tree. A microstate is an abstraction that we use to manipulate the state tree.

When you want to change what the user sees, you could imperatively manipulate the DOM elements with jQuery, but React taught us to change DOM declaratively by changing the data that the DOM reflects. In the same way, when you want to change the state, you must change the value and allow the state to be reflected. -->

# What is a Microstate?

A Microstate is a JavaScript object that is created from a type and POJO value. The shape and methods of the Microstate are determined by its type and the value it contains. A type describes the structure and transitions that can be performed on the microstate. Using type and value, Microstates derives a single immutable state tree.

# Types

Microstates comes with 5 primitive types: `Boolean`, `Number`, `String`, `Object` and `Array`. In addition to primivite types, Microstates allows you to declare `class` types and two kinds of parameterized types: `[Type]` and `{Type}`.

## Type Composition

Apart from these basic types, every other type in Microstates is composed out of other types. So for example, to create a `Person` you would define a JavaScript class and declare composed types with class properties(aka class fields).

```js
class Person {
  name = String;
  age = Number;
}
```

Once you have a type, you can use that type to create as many people as your application requires:

```js
import { create } from "microstates";

let person = create(Person, { name: "Homer", age: 39 });
```

Every microstate created with a type of `Person` will be an object that looks like this:

```txt
+----------------------+
|                      |       +--------------------+
|  Microstate<Person>  +-name--+                    +-concat()->
|                      |       | Microstate<String> +-set()->
|                      |       |                    +-state: 'Homer'
|                      |       +--------------------+
|                      |
|                      |       +--------------------+
|                      +-age---+                    +-increment()->
|                      |       | Microstate<Number> +-decrement()->
|                      |       |                    +-set()->
|                      |       |                    +-state: 39
|                      |       +--------------------+
|                      |
|                      +-set()->
|                      +-state: Person { name: 'Homer', age: 39 }
+----------------------+
```

## Composing types

Types can be composed with other types freely. This makes it possible to build complex data structures that accurately describe your domain. Since Microstates are atomic and all transitions return Microstates, Microstates can automatically handle transitions regardless of how your `class` types are composed.

Let's define another type that composes the person type.

```js
class Car {
  designer = Person;
  name = String;
}

let theHomerCar = create(Car, {
  designer: { name: "Homer", age: 39 },
  name: "The Homer"
});
```

`theHomerCar` object will have the following shape,

```txt
+-------------------+           +----------------------+
|                   |           |                      |       +--------------------+
|  Microstate<Car>  |           |  Microstate<Person>  +-name--+                    +-concat()->
|                   |           |                      |       | Microstate<String> +-set()->
|                   +-designer--+                      |       |                    +-state: 'Homer'
|                   |           |                      |       +--------------------+
|                   |           |                      |
|                   |           |                      |       +--------------------+
|                   |           |                      +-age---+                    +-increment()->
|                   |           |                      |       | Microstate<Number> +-decrement()->
|                   |           |                      |       |                    +-set()->
|                   |           |                      |       |                    +-state: 39
|                   |           |                      |       +--------------------+
|                   |           |                      |
|                   |           |                      +-set()->
|                   |           |                      +-state: Person<{ name: 'Homer', age: 39 }>
|                   |           +----------------------+
|                   |
|                   |           +--------------------+
|                   +-name------+                    +-concat()->
|                   |           | Microstate<String> +-set()->
|                   |           |                    +-state: 'The Homer'
|                   |           +--------------------+
|                   |
|                   +-set()->
|                   +-state: Car<{ designer: Person<{ name: 'Homer', age: 39 }> }, name: 'The Homer' }>
+-------------------+
```

The property names are important when defining `class` types because they are used to reference composed microstates. You can use the object dot notation to access a composed microstate. Using the same example from above:

```js
theHomerCar.designer.state;
//> Person<{ name: 'Homer', age: 39 }>

theHomerCar.designer.age.state;
//> 39

theHomerCar.name.state;
//> The Homer
```

## Array Microstates

Quite often it is helpful to describe your data as a collection of types. A blog might have an array of posts. To do this, you can use the array of type notation, `[Post]`. This signals that Microstates of this type represent an array whose members are each of the `Post` type.

```js
class Blog {
  posts = [Post];
}

class Post {
  id = Number;
  title = String;
}

let blog = create(Blog, {
  posts: [
    { id: 1, title: "Hello World" },
    { id: 2, title: "Most fascinating blog in the world" }
  ]
});

blog.posts[0].state;
//> Post<{ id: 1, title: 'Hello World' }>

blog.posts[1].state;
//> Post<{ id: 2, title: 'Most fascinating blog in the world' }>
```

When you're working with parameterized types, the shape of the Microstate is determined by the value. In this case, `posts` is created with two items which will, in turn, create a Microstate with two items. Each item will be a Microstate of type `Post`. If you push another item onto the `posts` Microstate, it'll be treated as a `Post`.

```js
let blog2 = blog.posts.push({ id: 3, title: "It is only getter better" });

blog2.posts[2].state;
//> Post<{ id: 3, title: 'It is only getter better' }>
```

## Object Microstates

You can also create a parameterized object with `{Post}`. The difference is that the collection is treated as an object. This can be helpful when create normalized data stores.

```js
class Blog {
  posts = { Post };
}

class Post {
  id = Number;
  title = String;
}

let blog = create(Blog, {
  posts: {
    "1": { id: "1", title: "Hello World" },
    "2": { id: 2, title: "Most fascinating blog in the world" }
  }
});

blog.posts["0"].state;
//> Post<{ id: 1, title: 'Hello World' }>

blog.posts["1"].state;
//> Post<{ id: 2, title: 'Most fascinating blog in the world' }>
```

Object microstates have `Object` transitions, such as `assign`, `put` and `delete`.

```js
let blog2 = blog.posts.put("3", { id: 3, title: "It is only getter better" });

blog2.posts["3"].state;
//> Post<{ id: 3, title: 'It is only getter better' }>
```

# Transitions

Transitions are declarative operations that you can perform on a microstate to derive another state. All transitions return another Microstate.

The simplest example of this is `toggle` transition on the `Boolean` type. The `toggle` transition takes no arguments and creates a new microstate with the state that is opposite of the current state. The `Boolean` type can be described with the following state chart.

![Boolean Statechart](README/boolean-statechart.png)

Here is what this looks like with Microstates.

```js
import { create } from "microstates";

let bool = create(Boolean, false);

bool.state;
//> false

let b2 = bool.toggle();

b2.state;
//> true
```

An important quality of the transitions in Microstates is that they always return a Microstate. This is true inside of transition functions and outside where the transition is invoked. Microstates use this convention to allow composition to reach crazy levels of complexity.

Let's compose a Boolean into another class type and see what happens.

```js
class App {
  name = String;
  notification = Modal;
}

class Modal {
  text = String;
  isOpen = Boolean;
}

let app = create(App, {
  name: "Welcome to your app",
  notification: {
    text: "Hello there",
    isOpen: false
  }
});

let opened = app.notification.isOpen.toggle();
//> Microstate<App>

opened.valueOf();
//> {
// name: 'Welcome to your app',
// notification: {
//   text: 'Hello there',
//   isOpen: true
// }}
```

In the above example, I invoked the boolean transition on `app.notification.isOpen` but we still got a new App Microstate. The value was changed immutably without modifying the original object and the transition returned a new App Microstate.

## Primitive type transitions

The primitive types have predefined transitions,

* `Boolean`
  * `toggle(): Microstate` - return a Microstate with opposite boolean value
* `String`
  * `concat(str: String): Microstate` - return a Microstate with `str` added to the end of the current value
* `Number`
  * `increment(step = 1: Number): Microstate` - return a Microstate with number decreased by `step`, default is 1.
  * `decrement(step = 1: Number): Microstate` - return a Microstate with number decreased by `step`, default is 1.
* `Object`
  * `assign(object): Microstate` - return a Microstate after merging object into current object.
  * `put(key: String, value: Any): Microstate` - return a Microstate after adding value at given key.
  * `delete(key: String): Microstate` - return a Microstate after removing property at given key.
* `Array`
  * `map(fn: (Microstate) => Microstate): Microstate` - return a Microstate with mapping function applied to each element in the array. For each element, the mapping function will receive the microstate for that element. Any transitions performed in the mapping function will be included in the final result.
  * `push(value: any): Microstate` - return a Microstate with value added to the end of the array.
  * `pop(): Microstate` - return a Microstate with last element removed from the array.
  * `shift(): Microstate` - return a Microstate with element removed from the array.
  * `unshift(value: any): Microstate` - return a Microstate with value added to the beginning of the array.
  * `filter(fn: state => boolean): Microstate` - return a Microstate with filtered array. The predicate function will receive state of each element in the array. If you return a falsy value from the predicate, the item will be excluded from the returned microstate.
  * `clear(): microstate` - return a microstate with an empty array.

Many transitions on primitive type are similar to methods on original classes. The biggest difference is that transitions always return Microstates.

## class type transitions

You can define transitions for class types. Inside of a transition, you can invoke transitions on other microstates that are composed onto this microstate. You can use the fact that composed microstates always return root microstates to chain transitions.

```js
import { create } from "microstates";

class Person {
  name = String;
  age = Number;

  changeName(name) {
    return this.name.set(name);
  }
}

let homer = create(Person, { name: 'Homer', age: 39 });

let lisa = homer.changeName('Lisa');
```

## chaining transitions

The result of the last operation in the chain will be merged into the microstate.

```js
class Session {
  token = String;
}

class Authentication {
  session = Session;
  isAuthenticated = Boolean;

  authenticate(token) {
    return this
      .session.token.set(token)
      .isAuthenticated.set(true);
  }
}

class App {
  authentication = Authentication
}

let app = create(App, { authentication: {} });

let authenticated = app.authentication.authenticate('SECRET');

authenticated.valueOf();
//> { authentication: { session: { token: 'SECRET' }, isAuthenticated: true } }
```

## `initialize` transition

The `initialize` transition converts value into a Microstate when a Microstate is being created with the `create` function. The initialize transition is invoked for every microstate that declares one. They are called from top to bottom, meaning that a parent microstate is initalized before the children. This is imporant because the parent microstate can change what children are created.

You can use this mechanism to change the value that is used to initialize children Microstates.

For example:

```js
class Person {
  firstName = String;
  lastName = String;

  initialize({ firstname, lastname } = {}) {
    let initialized = this;

    if (firstname) {
      initialized = initialized.firstName.set(firstname);
    }

    if (lastname) {
      initialized = initialized.lastName.set(lastname);
    }

    return initialized;
  }
}
```

## `set` transition

The `set` transition is the only transition that is available on all types. It can be used to replace the value of the current Microstate with another value.

```js
import { create } from 'microstates'

let number = create(Number, 42).set(43);

number.valueOf()
//> 43
```

You can also use `set` transition to replace the current Microstate with another Microstate. This is especially useful when building state machines because it allows you to change the type of the current Microstate. By changing the type, you're also changing available transitions and how the state is calculated.

```js
import { types } from 'microstates';

class Vehicle {
  weight = Number;
  towing = Vehicle;

  get isTowing {
    return !!this.towing;
  }

  get towCapacity() {
    throw new Error('not implemented');
  }

  tow() {
    throw new Erorr('not implemented');
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {}

class Truck extends Vehicle {
  towCapacity = Number;

  tow(vehicle) {
    if (vehicle.weight.state < this.towCapacity.state) {
      return this.towing.set(vehicle);
    } else {
      throw new Error(`Unable to tow ${vehicle.weight.state} because it exceeds tow capacity of ${this.towCapacity.state}`);
    }
  }
}

class Friend {
  vehicle = Vehicle;
}

let prius = create(Car, { weight: 3000 });

let mustang = create(Car, { weight: 3500, towCapacity: 1000 });
let f150 = create(Truck, { weight: 5000, towCapacity: 13000 });

let rob = create(Friend).vehicle.set(mustang);
let charles = create(Friend).vehicle.set(f150);

rob.vehicle.tow(prius);
//> Error: not implemented

let result = charles.vehicle.tow(prius)

result.vehicle.state.isTowing
//> true
```

Those familiar with functional programming might recognize this as a flatMap operation. It is not required for you to understand Monads to use Microstates transitions. If you're interested in learning about the primitives of functional programming, you may checkout [funcadelic.js](https://github.com/cowboyd/funcadelic.js). Microstates uses Funcadelic under the hood.

## Scope rules

For Microstates to be composable, they must work the same as a root Microstate or composed into another Microstate. For this reason, Microstate transitions only have access to their own transitions and the transitions of the Microstates that are composed into them. They do not have access to their context. This is similar to how components work. The parent component can render a child component and pass data to them. The children components do not have direct access to the parent component. Same in Microstates.

# State Machines

A state machine is a system that has a predefined set of states. At any given point, the state machine can only be in one of these states. Each state has a predefined set of transtions that can be derived from that state. These constraints are beneficial to application architecture because they provide a way to identify application state and suggest how the application state can change.

From its conception, Microstates was created to be the most convinient way to express state machines. The goal was to design an API that would eliminate the barrier of using state machines and allow for them to be composable. The result of 2 years of work is an API that does not look like a traditional state machine.

## Explicit Transitions vs Transition Matching

Most state machine libraries focus on finding the next state given configuration. For example, [xstate](https://github.com/davidkpiano/xstate#finite-state-machines) declaration describes what state id to match when in a specific state.

```js
import { Machine } from 'xstate';

const lightMachine = Machine({
  key: 'light',
  initial: 'green',
  states: {
    green: {
      on: {
        TIMER: 'yellow',
      }
    },
    yellow: {
      on: {
        TIMER: 'red',
      }
    },
    red: {
      on: {
        TIMER: 'green',
      }
    }
  }
});
```

Here is equivalent state machine in Microstates,

```js
class LightMachine {
  color = String;

  initialize({ color: 'green' } = {}) {
    return this.color.set(color);
  }

  timer() {
    switch (this.color.state) {
      case 'green': return this.color.set('yellow');
      case 'yellow': return this.color.set('red');
      case 'red':
      default:
        return this.color.set('green'); 
    }
  }
}
```

With Microstates, you explicitely describe what happens on transition and define the matching mechanism. 

### No transitionTo function

`transitionTo` is often used by state machine libraries to trigger state transition. 

Here is an example with xstate library,

```js
const nextState = lightMachine.transition('green', 'TIMER').value;

//> 'yellow'
```

Microstates does not have such a method. Instead, next state is derived by invoking a method on the microstate which returns the next state.

```js
import { create } from 'microstates';

let lightMachine = create(LightMachine);

const nextState = lightMachine.timer();

nextState.color.state
//> 'yellow'
```

Again, different approaches with their own tradeoffs. 

## Functional Immutable Object vs Functional Immutable Data Structure

I will use xstate as an example again because it's the best library in this category. When you create a state machine with xstate, you create a functional immutable object. When you invoke a transition on the state machine, the value of the object is the ID of the next state. All of the concerns of immutable value change as a result of state change are left for you to handle manually.

Microstates treats value as part of the state machine which allows you to handle immutable state transitions as part of your state transition declaration. It allows you to colocate your state transitions with reducers that change the value of the state.

*NOTE*: This entire section is not meant to be a criticism of `xstate` library. It's a great library and it addresses real need for state machines and statecharts. I'm using it to illustrate API choices that Microstates made.

# `microstates` npm package

The `microstates` package provides the `Microstate` class and functions that operate on Microstate objects.

You can import the `microstates` package using:

```bash
npm install microstates

# or

yarn add microstates
```

Then import the libraries using:

```js
import Microstate, { create, from, map } from "microstates";
```

## create(Type, value): Microstate

The `create` function is conceptually similar to `Object.create`. It creates a Microstate object from type class and a value. This function is lazy, so it should be safe in most high performant operations even with complex and deeply nested data structures.

```js
import { create } from "microstates";

create(Number, 42);
//> Microstate
```

## from(any): Microstate

`from` allows the conversion of any POJO (plain JavaScript object) into a Microstate. Once you've created a Microstate, you can perform operations on all properties of the value.

```js
import { from } from "microstates";

from("hello world");
//Microstate<String>

from(42).increment();
//> Microstate<Number>

from(true).toggle();
//> Microstate<Boolean>

from([1, 2, 3]);
//> Microstate<Array<Number>>

from({ hello: "world" });
//> Microstate<Object>
```

`from` is lazy, so you can consume any deeply nested POJO and Microstates will allow you to perform transitions with it. The cost of building the objects inside of Microstates is paid whenever you reach for a Microstate inside. For example, `let o = from({ a: { b: c: 42 }})` doesn't do anything until you start to read the properties with dot notiation like `o.a.b.c`.

```js
from({ a: { b: c: 42 }}).a.b.c.increment().valueOf();
// { a: { b: { c: 43 }}}

from({ hello: [ 'world' ]}).hello[0].concat('!!!').valueOf();
// { hello: [ 'world!!!' ]}
```

## map(fn, microstate): Microstate

The `map` function invokes the function for each microstate in an array microstate. It usually used to map over an array of microstate and return an array of components. The mapping function will receive each microstate in the array. You can invoke transitions on each microstate as you would usually.

```js
let numbers = create([Number], [1, 2, 3, 4]);

<ul>
  {map(number => (
    <li onClick={() => number.increment()}>{number.state}</li>
  ), numbers)}
</ul>
```

## use(middleware, microstate: Microstate): Microstate

The `use` function is used to add middleware to a microstate. This function will return a new microstate with the provided middleware installed. 

```js
import { use, from } from "microstates";

let number = from(42);

const loggingMiddleware = next => (microstate, transition, args) => {
  console.log(`before ${transition.name} value is`, microstate.valueOf());
  let result = next(microstate, transition, args);
  console.log(`after ${transition.name} value is`, result.valueOf());
  return result;
}

let loggedNumber = use(loggingMiddleware, number);

loggedNumber.increment();
// before increment value is 42
// after increment value is 43
```

# Middleware

Middleware makes it possible to modify what occurs before a transition is performed and what is ultimately returned by a transition. You can use it to change the outcome of a transition or emit side effects.

Installation of a middleware is done in an immutable fashion as with all other operations in Microstates. To install a middleware, you must map a microstate to create a new microstate that uses the given middleware.

Let's create logging middleware that will log every transition:

```js
import { create, map } from "microstates";

class Person {
  firstName = String;
  lastName = String;
}

let homer = create(Person, { firstName: "Homer", lastName: "Simpson" });

function loggingMiddleware(next) {
  return (microstate, transition, args) => {
    console.log(`before ${transition.name} value is`, microstate.valueOf());
    let result = next(microstate, transition, args);
    console.log(`after ${transition.name} value is`, result.valueOf());
    return result;
  };
}

let homerWithMiddleware = use(loggingMiddleware, homer);
```

The middleware will be invoked on any transition that you call on this Microstate. The middleware will be carried over on every consequent transition as it is now part of the Microstate. We use this mechanism to create Observable Microstates.

# Observable Microstates

Microstates provides an easy way to convert a Microstate which represents a single value into a Observable stream of values. This is done by passing a Microstate to `Observable.from` function. This function will return a Observable object with a `subscribe` method. You can subscribe to the stream by passing an observer to the subscribe function. Once you subscribe, you will syncronously receive a microstate with middleware installed that will cause the result of transitions to be pushed through the stream.

You should be able to use to any implementation of Observables that supports `Observer.from` using [symbol-observable](https://github.com/benlesh/symbol-observable). We'll use `RxJS` for our example.

```js
import { from } from "rxjs";
import { create } from "microstates";

let homer = create(Person, { firstName: "Homer", lastName: "Simpson" });

let observable = from(homer);

let last;
let subscription = observable.subscribe(next => {
  // capture the next microstate coming through the stream
  last = next;
});

last.firstName.set("Homer J");

last.valueOf();
//> { firstName: 'Homer J', lastName: 'Simpson' }
```

This mechanism provides the starting point for integration between the Observables ecosystem and Microstates.

# The Vision of Microstates

What if switching frameworks were easy? What if a company could build domain specific code that worked across frameworks? Imagine what it would be like if you tools stayed with you as you progressed in your career as an engineer. This is the world what we hope to create with Microstates.

## Shared Solutions

Imagine never having to write another normalized data store again because someone made a normalized data store Microstate that you can compose into your app's Microstate.

In the future(not currently implemented), you will be able to write a normalized data store like this,

```js
import Normalized from "future-normalized-microstate";

class MyApp {
  store = Normalized.of(Product, User, Category);
}
```

The knowledge about building normalized data stores is available in libraries like [Ember Data](https://github.com/emberjs/data), [Orbit.js](https://github.com/orbitjs/orbit), [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com) and [urql](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql), yet many companies end up rolling their own because these tools are coupled to other stacks.

As time and resources permit, we hope to create a solution that will be flexible enough for use in most applications. If you're interested in helping us with this, please reach out.

## Added Flexibility

Imagine if your favourite Calendar component came with a Microstate that allowed you to customize the logic of the calendar without touching the rendered output. It might looks something like this,

```js
import Calendar from "awesome-calendar";

class MyCalendar extends Calendar.Model {
  // make days as events
  days = Day.of([Event]);

  // component renders days from this property
  get visibleDays() {
    return this.days.filter(day => day.status !== "finished");
  }
}

<Calendar.Component model={MyCalendar} />;
```

Currently, this is pseudocode, but Microstates was architected to allow for these kinds of solutions.

## Framework Agnostic Solutions

Competition moves our industry forward but consensus builds ecosystems.

Unfortunately, when it comes to the M(odel) of the MVC pattern, we are seeing neither competition nor consensus. Every framework has its own model layer that is not compatible with others. This makes it difficult to create truly portable solutions that can be used on all frameworks.

It creates lock-in that is detrimental to the businesses that use these frameworks and to the developers who are forced to make career altering decisions before they fully understand their choices.

We don't expect everyone to agree that Microstates is the right solution, but we would like to start the conversation about what a shared primitive for state management in JavaScript might look like. Microstates is our proposal.

In many ways, Microstates is a beginning. We hope you'll join us for the ride and help us create a future where building stateful applications in JavaScript is much easier than it is today.

# FAQ

## What if I can't use class syntax?

Classes are functions in JavaScript, so you should be able to use a function to do most of the same things as you would with classes.

```js
class Person {
  name = String;
  age = Number;
}
```

‚òùÔ∏è is equivalent to üëá

```js
function Person() {
  this.name = String;
  this.age = Number;
}
```

## What if I can't use Class Properties?

Babel compiles Class Properties into class constructors. If you can't use Class Properties, then you
can try the following.

```js
class Person {
  constructor() {
    this.name = String;
    this.age = Number;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.boss = Person;
  }
}
```
