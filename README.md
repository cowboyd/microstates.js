# Microstates

Composable State Primitives with GraphQL inspired API     

Microstates is a pure JavaScript model authoring system designed to ease state management in component based applications.

By combining lazy execution, algebraic data types and structural sharing, we created
a tool that provides a tiny API to describe complex data structures and provide a
mechanism to change the value in immutable way.

## Why Microstates?

With microstates added to your project, you get: 

- üç£ Atomic composable type system
- üç± Effortless composition of types
- üíé Pure immutable state transitions without reducers
- üî≠ Optional integration with Observables
- üéØ Transpilation free type system
- ‚öõ Use in Node.js and web applications
- ü¶ã Easiest way to express state machines

But, most imporantly, Microstates makes working with **state fun**. 

## ü§ó Having fun with state 

When was the last time you had fun working with state in JavaScript applications? For many, the answer is probably never because state management in JavaScript is an endless game of choosing from compromises. You can choose to go fully immutable and end up writing endless reducers. You can go mutable and everything magically becomes an observable. Or you can `setState` and loose the benefit of serialization and time travel debugging. 

Unlike the view layer, where most frameworks agree on some variation of React components, state management is alloot less certain. It's less certain because none of the available tools strike the balance that React components introduced to the view layer. 

React components have a tiny API, they are functional, simple and extremely reusable. The tiny API gives you high productivity for little necessary knowledge. Functional components are predictable and easy to reason about. They are conceptually simple, but simplicity hides architecture that makes them performant. Their simplicity, predictability and isolation makes them composable and reusable.

These factors combined is what makes React style components easy to work with and ultimately fun to write. Tiny API abstracting sophisticated architecture that delivers performance and is equaly useful on small and big projects is the outcome that we set out to achieve for state management with Microstates. 

It's not easy to find the right balance between simplicity and power, but considering the importance of state management in web applications, we believe it's a worthy challenge.

## What is a Microstate?

A Microstate is an JavaScript object that is created from a Microstate type. Microstate types are similar to JavaScript classes except instances created from Microstate types are immutable, which means that they can not be modified after they were created. To modify an immutable object, you must create a copy of the original object with the change that you wish to make.

Let's consider the implication of this for a minute. JavaScript objects are mutable. If you create an instance of a JavaScript class, the created objects are mutable. 

**ü§î How does an immutable class instances work?**

This is the not the question that we set out to answer when we started working on Microstates in 2016, but it's one of the question that we believe Microstates is answering.

The challenge with answering this question is that it uproots a lot of what we know about working with JavaScript classes. Let's consider some of these and see where it takes us.

### Instance Methods

Instance methods are functions that can modify properties of the object. For example, `setFirstName` might modify the `firstName` on an instance of `Person`.

```js
// typical JavaScript class (not Microstate)
class Person {
  constructor({ firstName, lastName }) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
    this.lastName = lastName;
  }

  setFirstName(firstName) {
    this.firstName = firstName;
  }
}

let homer = new Person({ firstName: 'Homer', lastName: 'Simpson' });

homer.setFirstName('Homer J');
```

But what if the instance is immutable, `setFirstName` must return a new instance of `Person` class without modifying the original object. This raises another question, how do you create a copy of an instance of a class? I won't answer this question here, but I'll just say that Microstates does it.

Let's see what this would look like with a Microstate.

```js
// this is a Microstate type
class Person {
  firstName = String;
  lastName = String;

  setFirstName(firstName) {
    return this.firstName.set(firstName);
  }
}

import { create } from 'microstates';

let homer = create(Person, { firstName: 'Homer', lastName: 'Simpson' });

// original homer is unmodified
let homerJ = homer.setFirstName('Homer J');
```

Unlike a regular JavaScript class methods which imperatively mutate objects they have access to, Microstates types declaratively describe what should be different in the copy that's returned from the method.

### Getters

Getters on JavaScript objects are evaluated everytime that a getter is read. This can very wasteful when properties of an object haven't changed. Frameworks like Ember and Vue have *computed properties* which memoize computations and automatically recompute when a property changes. 

Tracking property changes is not possible in pure JavaScript, as a result there is no safe way to cache getters on JavaScript objects. This limitation of getters can lead to very suble performance problems when used in frameworks like React that use shallow equality to determine if components need to rerender.

Consider the following example,

```js
// regular JavaScript class
class Shop {
  constructor({ products, filter }) {
    this.products = products;
    this.filter = filter;
  }

  get filtered() {
    return this.products.filter(product => product.category === this.filter);
  }
}

let filter = 'clothing';
let products = [ 
  { name: 'Pants', category: 'clothing' },
  { name: 'Shirt', category: 'clothing' },
  { name: 'Watch', category: 'accessory' }
]

let shop = new Shop({ products, filter });

shop.filtered === shop.filtered
//> false
```

If you passed `shop.filtered` to a React component, this React component would re-render every time that the parent component's render function is called even though neither `products` nor `filter` is changed.

This is a very different story in Microstates because Microstate instances are 
immutable. There is no need for property tracking, because properties can not change. In Microstates, it's safe to automatically cache getters because for any state they can only ever have one result. 

Here is how this example would look in Microstates,

```js
// Microstate type (this annotations are for reads, they don't do anything special)
class Shop {
  products = [Product]
  filter = String

  get filtered() {
    return this.products.filter(product => product.category === this.filter);
  }
}

class Product {
  name = String;
  category = String;
}

let filter = 'clothing';
let products = [ 
  { name: 'Pants', category: 'clothing' },
  { name: 'Shirt', category: 'clothing' },
  { name: 'Watch', category: 'accessory' }
]

import { create } from 'microstates';

let shop = create(Shop, { products, filter });

shop.state.filtered === shop.state.filtered
//> true
```

Cached getters in Microstates make computed properties available in all frameworks, not just Vue and Ember. For those familiar with Reselect, cachged getters can replace Reselect for most applications.



<!-- ## API

Microstates API gives developers a way to declaratively express the relationship between different fragments of state and how that state can change. To say it another way, Microstates gives a way to compose state and describe operations that you can perform on that state. This combination of composed state and operations are referred to as *type*. 

Types can be composed from types that are built into JavaScript and custom types that you write yourself. Currently, Microstate supports `Boolean`, `Number`, `String`, `Object` and `Array` types which come from JavaScript. These are what we call *primitive* types, meaning that they do not contain other types. 

These primitive types can be combined into more complex types. For example, we can describe a `Person` by their `name` which is a `String` and their `age` which is just a `Number`. You can express `Person` type you define a JavaScript class.

```js
class Person {
  name = String;
  age = Number;
}
```

By itself, this type is not very useful. It's only a way to describe the structure of the data. To make this  -->


## FAQ

### What if I can't use class syntax?

Classes are functions in JavaScript, so you should be able to use a function to do most of the same
things as you would with classes.

```js
class Person {
  name = String;
  age = Number;
}
```

‚òùÔ∏è is equivalent to üëá

```js
function Person() {
  this.name = String;
  this.age = Number;
}
```

### What if I can't use Class Properties?

Babel compiles Class Properties into class constructors. If you can't use Class Properties, then you
can try the following.

```js
class Person {
  constructor() {
    this.name = String;
    this.age = Number;
  }
}

class Employee extends Person {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.boss = Person;
  }
}
```
